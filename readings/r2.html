        <h1>What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms?</h1>
        <p>
          In "Turing Complete User," universal users are defined as "users who have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device. Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it" (Lialina). I think Lialina's definition of the universal user makes sense coming from their perspective as someone who advocates for the separation and agency of the user from the computer. By defining the user and creating the term "universal user," they've pointed to the existence of the user as someone that is much more complex than those advocating for invisible computers seem to believe. Some of the examples Lialina gives depict people who behave in a number of unpredictable and irrational ways, simply because people are unpredictable and irrational. When describving their own experiences, Lialina states that, "[y]ou can have two Twitter accounts and log in to one in Firefox, and the other in Chrome. This is how I do it and it doesn’t matter why I prefer to manage it this way" (Lialina). Blurring the borders between the user and the experience help to streamline the process of engagement with an interface, but that smoothness can never be guaranteed. There will always be people who stubbornly interact with applications in their own ways. In other words, the universal user is a user with conscious thought and ego to do whatever they want.

        <p>
          If we consider the universal user as someone who does whatever they want however they want to, then that helps to understand Schwulst's argument advocating for individual websites. Since Schwulst frequently writes about the artist's agency in creating their own space on the web, thinking of the artist as a universal user helps to cement the idea that, "[a]rtists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition" (Schwulst). Artists are people capable of creating spaces catered to their own workflows using processes that continually hone their skills as creative thinkers.

        <h1>What kind of computer user are you?</h1>
        <p>
          Lialina describes two different kinds of users; "very busy" users and general purpose/universal users. They criticize the idea of a "very busy" user as they find it problematic to separate the user from the computer, or to think of the backend work behind computers and software as menial compared to "real jobs" separate from the machine. Although they describe general purpose users as having " [b]ehavior that is antipodal to the “very busy” user" (Lialina), I think I, and most other people, fluctuate between being both. Lialina may consider their behaviours opposite ends of the same spectrum, but I'd argue that these behaviours can go hand-in-hand, or sometimes overlap with each other. I sometimes use software inefficiently, but that isn't exactly me making the conscious decision to fill in the gaps or contribute to a softwares workflow—it's just a second nature habit. And I'd argue that doing things out of habit is the same as being "very busy," or too busy to really think about the application behind the work that's being done. There are times when I want to push the limits of the software I'm working with the see what I can of results I can achieve, but there are also times when I don't need to think about those things. I think there are a lot of times when it's fine to rely on the smoothness of software, as long as you're doing what you want to achieve results you want.
