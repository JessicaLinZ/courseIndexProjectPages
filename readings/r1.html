        <h1>Define what you consider to be the authors positions in relation to these two topics and how they overlap. What connections can you draw between these two articles? Do they prescribe solutions that are pertinent to each other? </h1>
        <p>
          John-Patrick Hartnett’s position in his article, “The programmed designer,” seems centered around the idea that major corporations’ ownership of industry standard tools not only limits a designer’s autonomy but is also pervasively tied to a designer’s identity. They also highlight the importance of open-source software—and understanding the technology we use—as a form of agency over one’s own practice.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Gavin Mueller’s “Microsoft and the Yeoman Coders,” however, looks at open-source technology less so as a means for individual autonomy and more so as a major foundation or infrastructure that should be more organized and maintained by the community at large. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          I think these two ideas don’t have to be mutually exclusive to one another. While Hartnett’s article seems to focus more on the corporation versus the individual, they also state that, “The autonomy that open-source technology facilitates is central to its appeal, but the impact of such initiatives is arguably yet to be felt among the day-to-day practice of the profession.” Muller proposes that “[t]he changing terrain of digital capitalism means the old strategies of coding freedom won’t work... coders should strive for democracy at work instead,” and that, “[t]here are a number of encouraging signs that tech workers are moving away from the narrow craft sensibility and looking to mass worker organization for models.” While open-source tech can be an answer to achieving autonomy, ownership, and understanding of one’s work, creating a larger system for that technology to exist and be maintained is important for open-source initiatives to impact the industry and our professions. Decentralization and individual initiatives aren’t always as impactful or effective at smaller, independent scales while under capitalist systems.

        <h1>Aside from the mastery of certain digital tools and programs, what skills do you see as integral to your graphic design practice?</h1>
        <p>
          I see language and critique and integral skills to my graphic design practice. I think clear communication between peers and other designers helps further not just my own practice but others’ as well. Being able to observe and comment on others’ works helps develop skills for looking and speaking to my own work, or allows me to observe parts of their works and processes that I could benefit from incorporating into mine. Since we don’t always see the work that goes behind the final product, I think knowing how to talk about your own process clearly helps reinforce your understanding of how you yourself work, and gives peers more to think about beyond surface level comments about the visuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also see critique as a means to help others. As harsh as it can come off, I do think it’s important to be able to offer meaningful insights and perspectives on each other's work. I think supporting others this way is one of the most important experiences you can get out of a post-secondary design education, especially when this profession can feel alienating or competitive, and especially during COVID-19.
