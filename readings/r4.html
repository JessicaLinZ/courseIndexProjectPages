        <h1>What do you make of Steyerl’s point that linear perspective privileges the individual while also lessening one’s humanity by rendering that individual view according to scientific principles?</h1>
        <h1> Is it possible to maintain both a humanist and technological perspective?                                 </h1>
        <p>
          I don't agree with Steryerl's idea that linear perspective lessens one's humanity. As Steryel describes the relationship between the viewer and the vanishing point in linear perspective, they state that, " the spectator’s importance is also undermined by the assumption that vision follows scientific laws" (Steryel). However, I disagree that this relation undermines the spectator's importance, since I don't think engaging with the world and media through a scientific lens necessarily takes away from one's humanity. In other words, there is nothing inhuman about seeing the world from a scientific perspective. Steryerl treats linear perspectives as "supposedly objective laws of representation," but I think focusing on the way linear perspective is perceived as an objective view takes away from the value of studying linear perspective and using it as a tool for observing and studying the world. It doesn't need to be treated as this supposedly universal and objective form of representation. I think there is value and humanity in the way we study linear perspective as a tool for various creative outlets and media, as linear perspective can serve as a way for creatives to create convincing and believable spaces regardless of the medium. That doesn't necessarily mean that linear perspective must be used to create truthful, scientific, and objectively correct representations of spaces, but that linear perspective can be one of many methods used to support a viewer's experience and engagement with a work. Nothing—including linear perspective—can ever be an objectively faithful representation of space since each medium used to create these spaces can and will be affected by human bias and the decisions of the creator behind the work, and instead I think these spaces should be engaged with critically, knowing that they are spaces created by humans continuously using and developing new tools and forms of engagement.
