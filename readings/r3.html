        <h1>Find 1 unique example of a pattern in nature, that appears to be programmatic</h1>
        <p>
          I looked at examples of logarithmic spirals and the Fibonacci spiral in nature. These spirals are not always consistent in size, but are always consistent in shape. For example, the horns of Dall sheep may differ in size, but the overall shape stays the same. This pattern occurs because the parts of their horns grow at nonlinear rates; the top of the horn grows faster than the bottom. Shells, such as mollusk and nautilus shells, are another example of logarithmic spirals in nature. They follow the same pattern as Dall sheep horns where the newer chambers of their shells grow with the animal. Each new, successive chamber is grows larger than the last, resulting in outward spirals where the inner chambers are much smaller and more compact than the subsequent newer chambers. Other patterns that follow logarithmic spirals include the arms of spiral galaxies, tropical storms, and whirlpools. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This pattern is considered programmatic since it follows a predictable logarithmic model of growth that is measurable and consistent through mathematical models and approximations. Based on <a class="pLink" href="https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/images/upload_library/23/picado/seashells/espiraleng.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">these</a> diagrams, we can see how the size of the spiral—measured by the width from the origin point to the outer edges—increases, while the amplitude of the angels and the tangents to the outer edges remain constant. <br><br>
