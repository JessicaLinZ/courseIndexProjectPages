            <h1>Learning to take care of myself </h1>
            <p>
              I decided to base my poster around any aspect of my life under COVID-19: learning to take care of myself. Since my experiences with COVID-19 involved being more conscious of cleanliness and safety, handling my mental health, and moving out for the first time, I wanted my poster to represent the non-linear processes of learning to take care of yourself. That includes the failures and successes that inevitably occur. 
            </p>

            <p>
              In order to represent change over time, I chose to design my poster using Krita, a drawing and animation software. Since Krita has a timeline for animation and customizable onion skinning settings, I used the software’s animation capabilities to overlay images at varying opacities. Depending on where the play head was placed along the timeline and which frames the photos were positioned on, the level of opacity for each image would change. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Initially, I wanted to use plant life to represent growth, care, and maintenance, while also juxtaposing that imagery with depictions of garbage and messes. I ran into difficulties with including too many images since the software wasn’t built to handle rendering multiple high-res images on an animation timeline. Ultimately, I decided not to use the photos of garbage and dirty dishes I took and instead focused on images that represented the simple mundanity and loneliness of everyday life. The empty office chair in a bright room behind the windowpane is meant to show that sense of loneliness and isolation within one’s own home.

              <h1>Typesetting</h1>
              <p>
                For the type, I used 2 versions of one of 100R’s software: Orca. Orca is not quite a synthesizer, but it’s a coding program meant for creating music. Unlike text editors such as VS&nbspCode, text does not necessarily have to be written line-by-line and instead exists on a grid. I used this grid to arrange the type the way I wanted to, and used the coloured highlights built into the program to emphasize specific words—orange from the browser version and teal from the Uxn version. 
              </p>
    
              <p>
                I chose the phrases “Stay safe out there” and “Take care of yourself” since “stay safe” and “take care” have become common partings due to COVID-19.

                Rough drafts featuring a used bowl, different plant imagery, and coloured tints using Krita's onion skin settings. Krita's settings allow you to set the colours of Previous Frames and Next Frames, so placing images at different points in the timeline would vary the tints and opacities relative to where the play head was placed.

               These drafts contained about 3-4 images each, not including the screenshot of the text, but the final only contains 2 for simplicity and since the program had difficulty handling any more images than that.

                I received critiques surrounding the coloured tints I was using and advice for controlling them better. Because of how finicky the onion skin settings were with my images in Krita, I used the photo filters in Windows' default Photos app based on one of the suggestions I received in class. If Krita wasn't running so slowly, I would've liked to experiment with the colours in there instead, since it had a much wider range of settings. However, I just couldn't get them to render properly no matter how hard I tried.

                This iteration is closest to final poster. It acts as a bit of an inbetween of the original gray tones from the drafts and warmer tones I experiemented with later on.

                I almost chose this iteration for my final. I liked how warm and hazy the colours are and the way it has more positive connotations compared to the dreary blues and grays from before. Unfortunately, I was afraid that would take away from the idea of hardship and the difficulties of caring for yourself, especially since I decided not to use the photos of trash, my sink, the dishes, etc.
